Develop a Python program that generates a random number between 1 and 100, and allows the user to guess it within a limited number of attempts. The game should provide feedback ("Too high" or "Too low") after each incorrect guess and congratulate the player if they guess correctly.

Features to Implement:
Random Number Generation: The program should generate a random number between 1 and 100.

User Input Handling: The player should be able to input their guess.

Attempt Limit: The player gets a maximum of 10 attempts to guess the number.

Feedback System: After each guess, the program should tell the player if their guess was too high or too low.

Win/Lose Condition:

If the player guesses correctly, display a success message with the number of attempts taken.

If the player runs out of attempts, reveal the correct number.

Play Again Option: After the game ends, ask if the player wants to play again.
